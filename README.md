# Cyberpunk2077-Mod-Manager

The Cyberpunk2077 mod manager aims to take away a lot of the tedious, repetitive work that comes with installing mods for the game. The mod manager serves to check for any out of date mods through the NexusMods API, and move the mod files into their respective locations accordingly. 

# About
The motivation for this project is that I just simply love the game, and want to make a tool to make modding it easier.
